# PDF Q&A Agent

This AI agent answers questions from uploaded PDFs using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
It demonstrates skills in natural language processing, vector search, and LLM pipelines, allowing users to query documents intelligently.

## Features
- Upload any PDF and generate meaningful answers to your questions.
- Uses **LangChain** for chaining LLMs and handling queries.
- **Vector-based retrieval** with FAISS for fast and accurate responses.
- Minimal setup required â€” fully runnable in Google Colab.

## How it Works
1. PDF is loaded and split into manageable chunks.  
2. Embeddings are generated using **sentence-transformers**.  
3. Chunks are stored in a **FAISS vector store**.  
4. Users can input questions, and the model returns precise answers using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
